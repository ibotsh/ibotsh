Aspiring Data Analyst | Registered Behavior Technician (RBT)

With a MA in Applied Behavior Analysis, and current enrollment in an MS in Data Analytics, I bring a unique combination of analytical skills and a deep understanding of human behavior. My experience as a Registered Behavior Technician, and soon to be Board Certified Assistant Behavior Analyst, has honed my ability to gather, analyze, and interpret data to make evidence-based decisions.

In preparation for a career in data, I’ve completed courses in statistical modeling, data science fundamentals, and exploratory data analysis, with hands-on experience in Python and key data analysis techniques like forecasting. My goal is to leverage these skills to solve real-world problems, contribute to data-driven decision-making, and secure a long-term, ethical role in the field.

Beyond technical skills, I’m a disciplined self-starter with strong problem-solving abilities, a collaborative mindset, and a passion for continuous learning. Whether I’m lifting weights, playing in kickball league, exploring bikeable cities, building ebikes, or diving into complex datasets, I bring focus and determination to everything I do.

I’m actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills in data analysis, and I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals
